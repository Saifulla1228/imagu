                About IMAGU
               IMAGU was established in January 1996 to provide emergency assistance in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Since then, adhering to the concept of “psycho-social and self-reliance support,” JEN has been consistently in charge of offering support activities to those people who have been stricken with hardship due to conflicts and disasters across the globe, in every phase of recovery from emergency assistance to reconstruction.
                
                
                JEN became a non-profit organization in 2000, opening its headquarters in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Authorized by the National Tax Agency on September 1,2005, JEN offers assistance activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Tohoku, Kumamoto and Jordan (for Syrian Refugees), as of October 2016.
                
                <b></b> Mission and vision
                Our mission
                We put our utmost efforts into restoring a self-supporting livelihood both economically and mentally to those people who have been stricken with hardship due to conflicts and disasters. We do so promptly, precisely, and flexibly by fully utilizing local human and material resources, considering this the most promising way to revitalize the society.
                
                Furthermore, we also try to convey victims’ sufferings and their efforts to overcome such sufferings along with their hopes and desires to the rest of the world so that the value of peace is seen in a new light and is shared by people everywhere.</p>        
        <h4> Purpose</h4>
        <p> Globalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of NGOs. Many problems could not be solved within a nation. International treaties and international organizations such as the World Trade Organization were seen as too focused on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have evolved to emphasize humanitarian issues, developmental aid, and sustainable development. A prominent example of this is the World Social Forum which is a rival convention to the World Economic Forum held annually in January in Davos, Switzerland. The fifth World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in January 2005 was attended by representatives from more than 1,000 NGOs.4</p>
